The final model's accuracy is 86% . This is a reasonable balance between the two metrics and will allow the store to identify and target the majority of customers who will respond to marketing while not having to spend an excess of resources targeting large amounts of customers who will not respond.

<b>project Description:</b>

Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers. Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.
